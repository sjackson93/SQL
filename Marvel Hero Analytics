In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Marvel Hero data to answer questions about the data.

#1. Determine average height of Marvels by gender.

SELECT gender, ROUND(AVG(height_m),2) AS 'Avg_Height_Meters' 
FROM marvels
GROUP BY gender;

#2. Classify Marvels in one of three categories; 'Elite', 'Good', 'So-so'.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Total_Marvel',
    CASE
        WHEN popularity <= 10 THEN 'Elite Marvel'
        WHEN popularity <= 25 THEN 'Good Marvel'
        WHEN popularity <= 50 THEN 'So-So Mavel'
        ELSE 'Sucky Marvel'
    END as 'Marvel_Status'
FROM marvels
GROUP BY Marvel_Status;

#3. Determine average weight of Marvels and show only Marvels with a weight greater than 150.

SELECT name, ROUND(AVG(weight_kg)) AS 'Avg_weight'
FROM marvels
GROUP BY name
HAVING Avg_weight > 150 
ORDER BY Avg_weight;

#4. Show only the Marvels from the USA with the highest popularity.

SELECT name FROM marvels WHERE hometown = 'USA' AND popularity = 1;

#5. Show only the 'Good' or 'Neutral' female Marvels.

SELECT name, gender, alignment FROM marvels WHERE gender = 'Female' AND alignment <> 'Bad'
ORDER BY alignment;
