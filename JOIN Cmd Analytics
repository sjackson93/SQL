In this SQL code, I'm querying three seperate databases that holds differnt Marvel Hero data to answer questions about the data.

SELECT m.name, s.popularity, s.intelligence
FROM marvels AS m
LEFT OUTER JOIN stats AS s
ON m.id = s.marvel_id
ORDER BY s.intelligence desc;

SELECT m.name, m.alignment
FROM marvels AS m
JOIN xmen AS x
ON m.id = x.xmen_id;

SELECT m.name AS 'XMen', s.strength AS 'Strongest to Weakest'
FROM marvels AS m
JOIN stats AS s
JOIN xmen AS x
ON m.id = s.marvel_id AND m.id = x.xmen_id
ORDER BY s.strength desc;
